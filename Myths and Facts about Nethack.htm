<td>Welcome to Eva's Nethack page!  I noticed on the newsgroup <a
href="news:rec.games.roguelike.nethack">rec.games.roguelike.nethack</a>
that several false rumours about the game frequently circulated and
had to be debunked.  I decided to create a web page dedicated to these
myths about Nethack and the facts behind them.  The information on
this page has all been checked by source-diving and/or wizard-mode
experimentation in Nethack 3.3.0 or later versions, and I believe that
it is also correct for Slash'Em.  Many thanks go to Dylan
O'Donnell for the information on converting yourself that inspired me
to create this web page in the first place, and for several
corrections including alignment penalties for killing peaceful
monsters.  If you find anything wrong please <a

<h3>Myths About Forbidden Actions</h3>
<div>
<a name="align"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> If you wear a helm of opposite
alignment before the quest, your quest leader will not let you in, and
your game will be unwinnable.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> Simply remove the helm and you will
be allowed on the quest again.  A helm of opposite alignment only
causes a temporary alignment change which is reversed when the helm is
removed.  (Since it takes away all divine protection, it's still not a
good idea to wear one.)
<p>
If you convert yourself permanently (by sacrificing on a non-coaligned
altar), then you will render your game unwinnable.  You cannot convert
back, and your quest leader will not be fooled by your wearing a helm
of opposite alignment.
<p>
Under what circumstances will you convert yourself permanently?  There
is a myth about this too, and I am greatly indebted to <a
href="http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/">Dylan O'Donnell</a> for sorting 
me out.
<p>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> If your god is angry with you when you
attempt to convert an altar, you will be converted to the altar's god
instead.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> If your god is angry but your
alignment is positive, you can still convert altars.  Your god will
still be angry, but you can use the newly coaligned altar to mollify
him.
<p>
You will convert yourself if you try to convert an altar when your
alignment is negative, or if you sacrifice a unicorn of your own
alignment on another god's altar.
<p>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Unaligned altars (altars to Moloch)
can't be converted; it is harmful to even try.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> Unaligned altars in Gehennom cannot be
converted.  Unaligned altars outside of Gehennom, such as those on
some quests, can be converted normally.  It is, however, wholly
impossible to convert oneself to Moloch.

<a name="peaceful"></a>
There seems to be considerable confusion over the precise penalties
for killing tame and peaceful monsters.
<p>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Killing your pet will anger your god.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> This depends on how you kill it.  If
you kill it in an ordinary way (<i>e.g.</i> in combat), you will
``hear the rumble of distant thunder''.  The penalty will be -15 to
alignment and -1 to Luck, but your god will <strong>not</strong> become angry.
<p>
If you kill it by displacing it into a trap or water, you will
probably (75% chance) ``feel guilty about losing your pet like
this''.  If you do, then your god <strong>will</strong> become angry and you
will also lose 15 points of alignment.
<p>
If you drown it by quaffing or dipping at a fountain or kill it with a
scroll of genocide, there is no penalty.
<p>
The penalty for killing a peaceful monster is one or more of loss of
protection, loss of telepathy, reduced luck and reduced alignment,
depending on the type of peaceful monster killed.
<ul>
<li>Loss of protection is very rare as a penalty for killing peaceful
monsters.  It only happens if you kill a coaligned priest.  (The
commonest cause of lost protection is angering your god.)
<p>
<li>Loss of telepathy is the penalty for killing a peaceful human if
you're not chaotic.  The message associated with this is ``You
murderer!'' and you will also lose two points of Luck.
<p>
<li>If you manage to kill a peaceful monster without angering it, you
have a 50% chance of losing one point of Luck.  This is in addition to
the Luck penalty for murder described above and the penalty of -5 Luck
for killing a unicorn of your own alignment.  However, simply killing
a peaceful monster with one whack from a melee weapon will anger it
before it dies, avoiding this penalty.  Most wands and spells will
also anger a monster even if they kill it in one zap, but "beam"
attacks such as striking or polymorph have a chance of killing without
angering, and incurring the additional penalty.
<p>
<li>Killing a peaceful monster tends to carry a large alignment
penalty.  If the monster is a type which is always peaceful
(shopkeepers, priests, the Oracle, vault guards, watchmen and watch
captains, quest leaders and guardians, prisoners, members of friendly
races) the penalty is at least -15, except that there is no alignment
penalty for killing peaceful priests of Moloch.  If it is peaceful
because it is coaligned, the penalty is at least -9.  These penalties
only apply to monsters created peaceful, not ones which have
subsequently been made so.
<p>
Quest friendlies cause you to lose vast amounts of alignment,
coaligned priests carry a penalty of only -2 but should probably not
be killed because of the loss of protection, cross-aligned priests
carry a small alignment bonus, and priests of Moloch carry a large
alignment bonus.  If the monster is still peaceful when it dies (as
mentioned above, this is unlikely), there is an additional penalty of
-5, unless it was a quest leader or guardian or a priest.
</ul>
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="races"></a>
<ul>
<li>Regardless of your race, killing a peaceful <strong>human</strong> will
cause you to lose telepathy unless you are chaotic.  Killing a
peaceful elf, dwarf, gnome or orc will not.  Killing a
<strong>coaligned</strong> priest will also cause you to lose all your
protection, even if you are chaotic.
<li>Eating your own race is cannibalism and will give you permanent
aggravate monster and lower your luck unless you are an orc or
Cave(wo)man (or, in Slash'EM, a Lycanthrope or Vampire).
<li>Unless you are chaotic or polymorphed into a demon, sacrificing
your own race is a very bad idea.
<li>It's fairly obvious what monsters count as dwarves, gnomes, elves
or orcs, but working out what is and is not human can be a bit
trickier.  Anything represented by an @ sign that isn't obviously an
elf is human, including werecreatures and doppelgangers.  Keystone
Kops (anything represented by a K) are also human.  
<li>Slash'EM players should note that Elves and Drow are the same
species, and that if you are a Doppelganger you are racially human and
should not eat human corpses.  Orcish, lycanthropic and vampiric
players are not punished for eating or sacrificing their own race, but
for completeness, here's how it works for them:
<ul>
<li>Anything represented by an o is an orc, including goblins and
hobgoblins.
<li>Only lycanthropic monsters (were-things) are classified as the
same race as lycanthropic players.  I.e., a Lycanthrope will not feel
evil and fiendish when eating a human, only when eating another
lycanthrope.
<li>A Vampire will only feel evil and fiendish when eating a vampire
bat, a fire vampire or a star vampire.  Since these last two are not
undead humans but Lovecraftian monsters, it is probably a bug that
eating them counts as cannibalism.  Vampire corpses would also have
this effect, but they don't exist - vampires, and their lords and
mages, leave an old human corpse when killed.
</ul>
</ul>

<div>
<a name="adiff"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Prayer timeout is quicker for lawfuls
than for chaotics.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> Prayer timeout behaves exactly the
same way for all alignments.  The myth derives from a bug in Nethack
3.1.3 which caused it to be longer for crowned chaotics.
<p>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Lawful characters must not rob shops /
attack peaceful monsters / eat while satiated / ....
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> There are assorted actions (such as
robbing shops) for which lawfuls receive a -1 alignment penalty and
chaotics receive a +1 alignment bonus.  There are other actions (such
as eating while satiated) for which only Knights or Samurai are
penalised.  These class/alignment specific penalties are very minor
and can usually be safely ignored.  The alignment penalty for killing
peaceful monsters is more severe, but applies to all characters.  For
details of all actions which affect your alignment, see the Appendix
to <a href="http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/pray.html">Matthew
Lahut's Praying Spoiler</a>.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="keys"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> It's safe to unlock doors in Minetown
with a key in full view of the watchmen.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> The watchmen will still warn you and
then get angry if they notice you doing it.  Usually they don't,
because unlocking a door with a key normally only takes one turn,
while a lock pick or credit card takes longer.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="stone"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> If you fall into a pit while carrying a
cockatrice corpse, you will turn to stone.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> Falling will only turn you to stone if
you are actually wielding the corpse.  For details on all the ways in
which cockatrices and their corpses can petrify you, see <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/dcorbett42/nethack/cockatrice.htm">David
Corbett's cockatrice spoiler</a>.

<h3>Other Myths</h3>

<div>
<a name="altars"></a> 
Dropping items on altars to see whether they are blessed or cursed
works with an altar to any god, even Moloch, although obviously you
must not be blind or hallucinating at the time.  You can also buy
protection from any peaceful priest who is still in a temple of his or
her own alignment, even the priest of Moloch in the Valley of the
Dead.  (Slash'EM players should note that despite appearances, the
altar room on the Nightmare level is not a temple, so you cannot buy
protection from the priest there.)  Dylan O'Donnell's spoiler
collection includes more information
on <a href="http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/prst-343.txt">donating
to priests</a>.
<p>
By the way, altars and priests are ``coaligned'' if they are of the
same alignment as you, ``non-coaligned'' or ``cross-aligned'' if they
are of a different alignment, ``aligned'' if they are lawful, neutral
or chaotic, and ``unaligned'' if they are of Moloch.  Unaligned altars
do not appear in the main dungeon, only in Gehennom and some quests.
</div>

<hr>

<div>
<a name="cancel"></a>
Wands of cancellation are not as dangerous as many people imagine,
provided that you are careful not to put a charged one into your bag
of holding.
<ul>
<li>In vanilla Nethack, the only way to get your
entire inventory cancelled is to zap yourself with a wand of
cancellation or break one deliberately.  A wand of cancellation
exploding for any other reason, such as being hit by lightning, will
<strong>not</strong> cancel your inventory.  In Slash'EM, an exploding wand of
cancellation <strong>will</strong> cancel your inventory, so I keep mine in a
sack when not in use.  Also, in Slash'EM but not vanilla Nethack,
monsters can zap you with wands of cancellation.  When this happens,
each item in your inventory has a 1/24 chance of being cancelled.
Magic resistance provides complete protection against this.
<li>Although being cancelled is nasty, it only affects your equipment
- you do not lose any intrinsics.
<li>Cancelling a bag of holding makes it into an uncursed bag of
holding and does not affect the contents.  Great for bones piles which
include a cursed bag of holding full of useful equipment.
<li>Cancelling the blessed rustproof +6 Mjollnir makes it into the
uncursed rustproof +0 Mjollnir.  Probably only of interest to those
who are determined to enchant their artifact weapon to +7.
<li>Irina Rempt has written an excellent spoiler explaining everything
you could wish to know about <a
href="http://www.nethack.de/spoiler330/cancellation.txt">cancelling
objects</a>.
</ul>
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="water"></a>
Items dipped into holy or unholy water will not blank, dilute, rust,
get wet, or suffer any type of water damage.  They will simply be
blessed or cursed as appropriate.  Items dipped into uncursed water
will suffer the typical effects of getting them wet.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="pets"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> If you pick up corpses and drop them
before letting your pet eat them, it will keep it tamer.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> Your pet's apport, or willingness to
fetch, can be improved by feeding it personally.  However, only treats
will work for this purpose, and corpses aren't treats.  Tripe rations
and meatballs are treats for a dog.  Apples and carrots are treats for
a horse.
<p>
Your pet's tameness, or resistance to
going wild, increases whenever it eats, whether you've touched the
food or not.
<p>
I have written a spoiler with <a href="pets2.html">more information
about apport and tameness</a>, and Peter Snelling, Boudewijn Wayers
and Bryan Butler have written a <a
href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~vviitane/spoilers/pets">detailed
spoiler on training pets to steal</a>.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="invis"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> If you can see invisible, it's a good
idea to make your pets invisible.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> This is only applicable to steeds.
Invisibility has no effect on monster-vs-monster combat, but if your
steed is invisible, monsters will attack you rather than it more
often.  Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on how strong you
are and how much you care about keeping your steed alive.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="nymphs"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Female characters are less vulnerable
than male characters to nymphs.
<P>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> Although Nethack has nymphs "seduce"
males and "charm" females, the difference in the messages is purely
cosmetic and your gender has no effect on your vulnerability to
nymphs.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="time"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> If you start a game during a new moon,
your base luck will be -1.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> New moons have no effect on your base
luck.  The only effect they have is that cockatrices are slightly more
dangerous.  There is a one-point luck penalty for starting or
restoring a game on Friday the 13th, and a one-point luck bonus for
starting or restoring during a full moon (these can cancel each other
out).  Boudewijn Waijers and Dylan O'Donnell have written a spoiler giving full details of
the <a
href="http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/time-343.txt">effects
of time and date on the game</a>.
</div>
<p>
<hr>


<div>
<a name="intr"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Get teleportitis before eating a tengu
because then it's more likely to give you teleport control.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> When you eat a monster which can grant
multiple intrinsics, first the intrinsic it will try to grant is
chosen at random without reference to your current intrinsics, and
then it is determined whether or not it will be granted.  Of course,
it can only be granted if you don't already have it.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="rings"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Eating a ring of increase damage for
the intrinsic will permanently increase your food consumption.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> Eating rings or amulets does not
normally increase food consumption (unlike wearing them).  The
exception is that gaining intrinsic regeneration, conflict or hunger
by eating a ring will raise your food consumption by one point every
two turns (normal food consumption is one point per turn).
<p>
On the subject of rings and food consumption, there is no point in
constantly wearing two rings of slow digestion.  With one, your food
consumption is reduced to 1 point every 20 turns, but with two, it is
1 point every 10 turns, because both rings are causing their "ring
hunger" effect.  Because of the details of when ring hunger is checked
for, it is possible to reduce your food consumption to zero by wearing
two rings of slow digestion most of the time but removing each one
just before it would cause its hunger effect and replacing it
afterwards.
<p>
Dylan O'Donnell has written a <a
href="http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/food-343.txt">spoiler on
food</a> which includes a list of all factors which affect food
consumption.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="excal"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Getting Excalibur is easier for
Knights than for any other class.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> Any lawful character of level 5 or
higher has exactly the same chance of getting Excalibur by dipping.
Excalibur used to blast non-Knights in version 3.3.1, but this bug was
fixed in 3.4.0.
<p>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Excalibur is the Knight's first gift
from sacrificing.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> Actually, it cannot be obtained by
sacrificing at all, nor can it be generated randomly.
</div>
<p>
<hr>


<div>
<a name="spell"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Your spellcasting stat (Intelligence or
Wisdom, depending on your class) affects your chance of learning
spells.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> No matter what class you are,
Intelligence affects your chance of learning spells and Wisdom does
not.  The spellcasting stat applies to the chance of casting spells
successfully.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="conf"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Confusing yourself with a forgotten
spell is less useful in Nethack 3.4.3 than it used to be, because it
might stun you as well.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> It's true that forgotten spells can
stun you, but you can simply apply your unicorn horn and try again
until you are confused but not stunned.  Also, being stunned prevents
teleport control from working but does not affect the results of
reading any scroll apart from teleportation.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="square"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> The Vibrating Square will move if you
drop an object on it or dig down while standing on it.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> The Vibrating Square will never move
and cannot be destroyed.  Also, it cannot be generated inside a wall
or on a trap, although it can be generated under an object.  You will
feel a strange vibration under your feet whenever you move onto it.
This happens whether you walked onto it normally or (level-)teleported
there.  Even if you are levitating, flying or riding, you will still
feel the vibration.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="lowxl"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> Keep your experience level low so that
the monsters you encounter while climbing up with the Amulet and in
the Elemental Planes will be less dangerous.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> The upper limit on the difficulty level
of randomly generated monsters is normally the average of your
experience level and your current dungeon level.  Once you have the
Amulet of Yendor, however, the upper limit increases to the average of
your experience level and the dungeon level of Moloch's Sanctum.
(There is also a lower limit, but this depends only on the depth of
Moloch's Sanctum, not on your XL.)
Moloch's Sanctum can never appear above DL:45, and a post-quest
character will have at least XL 14 unless they have deliberately
level-drained themselves.
<p>
The randomly-occurring monster with the highest difficulty level is
the arch-lich, at 29.  To avoid meeting them, one would need to have
XL 12 or less (assuming the shallowest possible depth for Moloch's
Sanctum).  Most people avoid them by genociding them instead.  The
second most difficult monster is the Archon, at difficulty level 26,
and one would need XL 6 or less to avoid them.
<p>
Although the rules for generating monsters of a fixed class are
different (monsters of more than twice your XL are less likely to be
generated but can still appear), the only place this is likely to
cause trouble on the ascension run is the Astral Plane, and then only
if master liches and arch-liches have not been genocided.
</div>
<p>
<hr>

<div>
<a name="rodney"></a>
<span class="red">MYTH:</span> The Wizard of Yendor will reappear one
final time when you enter the Plane of Earth, and will never come back
again once you've killed him there.
<p>
<span class="red">FACT:</span> He can reappear on any of the Elemental
Planes after being killed on the Plane of Earth, but he cannot appear
on the Astral Plane.
