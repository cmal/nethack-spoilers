This tarfile is created automatically; please let me know if it's
doing something broken. Also let me know if anything about the
spoilers themselves seems wrong, inaccurate, or otherwise worthy of
comment; however, if it's after 2012-04-06 (which it will be, unless
you just downloaded this collection today), you may want to check
whether a fix has already been made to the latest version of the
spoilers, which will always live at:

LICENSE

Those spoilers originally compiled by Kevin Hugo, by Dylan O'Donnell,
or by Boudewijn Waijers, are subject to the following conditions:

# Redistribution, copying, and editing of these spoilers, with or
# without modification, are permitted provided that the following
# conditions are met:
# 
# 1. The original contributors to any spoiler must continue to be credited.
# 2. Any modifications to the spoiler must be acknowledged and credited.

Those originally compiled by anybody else are subject to whatever
license that anybody else placed on them. In most cases this is
going to be an implicit license which looks reasonably like the
one above, but if you're going to do anything particularly rash with
them you may care to check with the originator first (if you can
find them).
