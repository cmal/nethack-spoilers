<h1>The Gnomish Mines</h1>

<p>This is a downward-extending branch consisting of 8 or 9 levels; it is
reached by a second downstair in the <a href="dungeons.html">Dungeons of
Doom</a>, between DL 2 and DL 4. If the top level is at DL 3, it is
ineligible to leave bones due to its depth; otherwise, all levels except
Mines' End may leave bones.</p>

<p>The following special levels are found in this branch:</p>

<table>
<tr><td><a href="minetown.html">Minetown</a></td>
  <td>(3rd or 4th level, DL 5 to DL 8)</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="minesend.html">Mines' End</a></td>
  <td>(Bottom level, DL 10 to DL 13)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>All non-special levels are caverns, containing 7 gnomes, 2 dwarves,
a gnome lord, 2 random G and one random h. (However, note that if you
are playing a dwarf or gnome, two-thirds of these dwarves or gnomes
respectively will be made random monsters instead.) 6 random traps are
placed on each level, along with one random tool, 3 random loose gems
(or piles of gems), and three random other objects; in addition, the
rock is more heavily mineralised than the Dungeons of Doom. Monster
creation in this branch is biased towards lawful monsters.</p>
