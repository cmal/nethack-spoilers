<h1>Oracle</h1>

<p>The Oracle is located between levels 5 and 9 of the <a
href="dungeons.html">Dungeons of Doom</a>.</p>

<p>The Oracle level is eligible to leave bones files. Monster creation
on this level is biased towards neutral monsters.</p>

<p>There are five rooms to the sides of the above area, containing the
stairs (in separate rooms), five random monsters, three random traps,
and six random objects; they are linked to each other and to the
mapped room by corridors. The Oracle is at the centre of the 3*3 room
("Delphi"), amid the fountains; Delphi has a random empty doorway in
one wall. The marked statues are two of forest centaurs (NW and SE),
two of mountain centaurs (NE and SW), and four of plains centaurs (N,
W, S, and E). There are two random monsters in the area surrounding
Delphi.</p>

<p>#chatting to the Oracle can get you advice; the charge for a minor
oracularity (from the true rumours file) is 50 zorkmids, for a major
oracularity (specific, if highly cryptic, information) is
500&nbsp;+&nbsp;(50*XL); this exercises wisdom, and the first of each
type gives a small amount of experience.</p>
