<h1>Fake Wizard's Towers</h1>

<p>These are located between 1 and 4 levels above the
<a href="vs.html">Vibrating Square</a> level (and therefore between the
15th and 22nd levels of <a href="gehennom.html">Gehennom</a>, and between
DL 40 and DL 51).</p>

<p>The level without the portal is eligible to leave bones files; the
level with the portal is not.</p>

<p>This core of the level is surrounded by normal Gehennom-like maze;
the walls <em>are</em> diggable.</p>

<p>These towers are found on two levels; one tower contains a magic
portal leading to the bottom level of the (real)
<a href="wizard.html">Wizard's Tower</a> at the point marked 'x', the
other does not (an amulet being there instead). Both contain four
squeaky boards (marked), a vampire lord, and a random L; a single
kraken is found in the moat of each.</p>

<p>The name "fake wizard's towers" is a reference to earlier versions
in which the Wizard of Yendor lived in a similar structure surrounded
by maze; these days, he lives in a similar structure surrounded by a
much <em>larger</em> tower. Such is upward mobility.</p>
