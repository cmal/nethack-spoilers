This tarfile is created automatically; please let me know if it's
doing something broken. Also let me know if anything about the
Gazetteer itself seems wrong, inaccurate, or otherwise worthy of
comment; however, if it's after 2012-04-06 (which it will be, unless
you just downloaded this collection today), you may want to check
whether a fix has already been made to the latest version of the
Gazetteer, which will always live at:
