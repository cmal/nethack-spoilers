<h1>The Wizard's Tower</h1>

<p>This is an upward-extending set of 3 consecutive levels in <a
href="gehennom.html">Gehennom</a>, of which the bottommost is between
the 13th and 18th levels, and the topmost between the 11th and 16th
levels (and therefore the Tower is constrained to be between DL 36 and
DL 47). The Tower proper is reached by a magic portal in one of the <a
href="fakewiz.html">Fake Wizard's Towers</a>. The outer maze may contain
the stairs to <a href="vlad.html">Vlad's Tower</a>.</p>

<p>All three levels are no-teleport and have undiggable
floors; only the middle level is eligible to leave bones files.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Map details</h2>

<p>Each level of the Tower consists of a central core (the Tower
proper) surrounded by normal maze which contains the stairs allowing
passage through Gehennom; it is impossible to reach one area from the
other (the outer walls of the Tower being undiggable and
unphasable). It is, however, possible to level teleport out of (but
not into) the Tower.</p>

<p>You arrive in (and leave) the Tower at the magic portal marked in
the lower right. The small central tower contains a vampire lord and a
random L; the marked traps are squeaky boards. The moat surrounding it
contains two giant eels and two krakens. There is a random D near to
the portal, and the marked beehive is filled with its normal queen bee
and nine killer bees; in addition, randomly placed around the mapped
area (or the long corridor of the outer maze immediately to its right)
are three random &, a random D, and a random L; two random scrolls, a
random weapon, a random potion, and a random tool. There is a random
amulet on the upladder. All walls are undiggable and unphasable save
those of the small central tower.</p>

<p>In addition to the usual monsters and gold in the marked zoo, there
is a random amulet in the small room in the centre-left; also,
randomly placed around the mapped area (or the long corridor of the
outer maze immediately to its right) are two scrolls, two potions, and
a spellbook; a spiked pit, a sleeping gas trap, an anti-magic trap,
and a magic trap. All walls are undiggable and unphasable.</p>

<p>The Wizard of Yendor, with the Book of the Dead, occupies the
centre of the small tower; a hell hound and a vampire lord are next to
him, and the moat contains four giant eels, four krakens, and two
piranhas. Randomly placed around the mapped area (or the long corridor
of the outer maze immediately to its right) are four random &, a
random D, and a random H; three random spellbooks, two random scrolls,
two random potions, and a ruby; and a spiked pit, a sleeping gas trap,
an anti-magic trap, and a magic trap (in addition to the four marked
squeaky boards). The only entrance to the walkway surrounding the moat
is via a secret door randomly located in the west, east, or south
walls. All walls are undiggable and unphasable save those of the
small central tower.</p>
