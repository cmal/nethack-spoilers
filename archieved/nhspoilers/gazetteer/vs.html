<title>NetHack Gazetteer: The Vibrating Square</title>

<h1>The Vibrating Square</h1>

<p>This is located on the second-from-bottom level of
<a href="gehennom.html">Gehennom</a> (immediately above
<a href="sanctum.html">Moloch's Sanctum</a>), and therefore between the
19th and 23rd level of that branch (so between DL 44 and DL 52).</p>

<p>The Vibrating Square level is ineligible to leave bones files.</p>

<p>This is an ordinary <a href="gehennom.html">Gehennom</a> maze level
in most respects. Its floor is too hard to dig through, and
there is (initially) no downstair; the only way to proceed is to
perform the invocation ritual (reading the Book of the Dead while
carrying the lit Candelabrum of Invocation within five turns of having
rung the Bell of Opening) standing on the Vibrating Square.
Successfully doing so will create the downstair to
<a href="sanctum.html">Moloch's Sanctum</a> on the square itself, and
demolish the maze in the vicinity to create a ring of fire traps, a
ring of clear space, and a wide moat, in an outwards direction from
you.</p>

<p>The Vibrating Square can only be located by the message given when
passing over it; it cannot be detected by magic mapping, crystal ball,
or any other remote means, and it has no special map symbol. There are
some constraints on where it will be randomly placed when the level
is created (and once placed, it stays where it is):</p>

<ul>
<li>in a corridor (not in a wall)</li>
<li>at least five squares from the side of the map</li>
<li>at least four squares from the top or bottom of the map</li>
<li>not within a circle of eleven squares radius around the upstair</li>
<li>not in a straight line with the upstair</li>
<li>not on the same square as a trap</li>
</ul>

<p>It may be on the same square as a boulder or another item.</p>
