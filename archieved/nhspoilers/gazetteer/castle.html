<h1>The Castle</h1>

<p>This is the lowest level of the <a href="dungeons.html">Dungeons of
Doom</a>, located between the 25th and 29th levels.</p>

<p>The Castle is ineligible to leave bones files. The entire level is
no-teleport, and is considered a graveyard level for the purpose of
undead monsters leaving corpses.</p>

<small><a href="legend.html">Legend</a></small>

<p>This central section is flanked on both sides by narrow sections of
maze; the upstair is in the left-hand maze, and the one-way upstair
from the <a href="valley.html">Valley of the Dead</a> leads to a
random location in the right-hand maze. The only way down to the
Valley is through one of the five marked trapdoors in the Castle's
back corridor; if these are blocked, the only access to Gehennom is
via level teleport (the floor of the Castle level is undiggable
through).</p>

<p>There are two entrances to the Castle proper. The drawbridge may be
opened either by playing the correct tune on a musical instrument
(either by listening to the "Mastermind"-like clues<a
href="#mmind"><small><sup>*</sup></small></a>, or by being given the
tune by your god); or by more direct means. The alternative is to use
whatever means of crossing water you have available to go round to the
back door, though the trapdoors in the back corridor will still need
to be negotiated.</p>

<p>The Castle moat contains four sharks and four giant eels. The two
marked barracks contain their usual complement of soldiers and
officers; in addition, each corner tower contains two soldiers, and
the atrium eight soldiers and a lieutenant. The throneroom contains 27
monsters, roughly equally chosen from EHLMNORTXZ; the chest is behind
the throne. The alcoves between the marked storerooms contain two
random dragons each; the storerooms themselves are filled with weapons,
armour, food and gems (each of these in one storeroom, at
random). Finally, one of the corner towers at random contains a chest
holding a wand of wishing.</p>

<p><a name="mmind" id="mmind"><small><sup>*</sup></small></a>Any
instrument capable of carrying a tune (bugles, flutes, harps, and
horns other than horns of plenty), when played adjacent to either the
portcullis square or the moat square where the drawbridge comes down,
can open or close the drawbridge by playing the passtune (answer "no"
when asked about improvisation). The passtune consists of five notes
between A-G; incorrect guesses will give responses of "tumblers
clicking" for correct notes in the wrong position, or "gears turning"
for correct notes in the right position. Janis Papanagnou has written
an <a href="http://nethack.gridbug.de/mm.html">automated solver</a> for
this version of Mastermind.</p>
