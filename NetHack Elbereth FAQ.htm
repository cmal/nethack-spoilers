<h3><a id="whatis" name="whatis">What's Elbereth (a.k.a. the
E-word)?</a></h3>

<p>According to the Guidebook, in its discussion of the E)ngrave
command,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Engraving the word "Elbereth" will cause most monsters to not
attack you hand-to-hand (but if you attack, you will rub it out);
this is often useful to give yourself a breather. (This feature may
be compiled out of the game, so your version might not have
it.)"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(You can tell if Elbereth is complied into your version of the
game with #version or Meta-v.)</p>

<p>Thus, Elbereth can help protect you from attack. It is also a
popular way to protect stashes of equipment in the dungeon, even
those in containers, since gelatinous cubes will eat any container
except an ice box. Note that something (an item, you) must be on
the space where Elbereth is engraved for monsters to stay off the
space. Elbereth on an empty space has <strong>no effect</strong>.
Also, the effect of Elbereth is case-insensitive, but you exercise
wisdom if you engrave it thus: "Elbereth". (You can also bury
Elbereth in the middle of some other letters and it still works:
"fooElberethfoo".)</p>

<p>An identical effect can be obtained by dropping a <a
href="341/scrl-341.html#scare_monster">scroll of scare monster</a>.
In 3.4.0, you will be told that "&lt;affected monster&gt; turns to
flee!" when you drop the scroll or finish engraving Elbereth.
(However, scrolls of scare monster are a poor choice to protect
your stash, since they disintegrate once picked up enough.)</p>

<p>[Elbereth comes from J.R.R. Tolkien's writings set in
Middle-Earth, particularly <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> and
<cite>The Silmarillion</cite>; it was the Elves' name for a goddess
they particularly revered. A song in her praise proves to have bad
effects on Sauron's minions in <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>.
See also "Elbereth" under the specify command, "/".]</p>

<h3><a id="respect" name="respect">What monsters will respect
Elbereth (that is, not attack me)?</a></h3>

<p>It's easier to say what <strong>doesn't</strong> respect
Elbereth. The following will attack you anyway:</p>

<ul class="space">
<li><em class="underline">Any monster represented by an @</em>.
Generally, these are humans and elves; however, it also includes
shapechangers (werecreatures, chameleons, doppelgangers, and
sandestins) while in @ form. 
<p>Note that although K (Keystone Kops, Kop Sergeants, etc.) are
considered human for purposes of cannibalism and sacrifice, they do
respect Elbereth.</p>
</li>

<li><em
style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal">Shopkeepers,
guards, lawful high priests (only found on the Astral Plane), and
the Wizard of Yendor</em>. These are listed separately in the code
because they will not respect Elbereth even if polymorphed into
something else. (Note that you're very unlikely to be able to
polymorph the Wizard, but just in case...)</li>

<li><em class="underline">Any monster that is blind</em>. However,
it has to be a very special kind of blindness. Just lacking eyes
isn't enough&#8212;thus gelatinous cubes <strong>do</strong>
respect Elbereth, even though if you polymorph into one you can't
see anything, and they <strong>won't</strong> eat your stash if
it's <a href="#engrave">properly engraved</a>. Instead, it has to
be blindness caused by an external source: blindfold, lightning
flash, potion of blindness, cream pies, or the blinding effects of
being attacked by exploding yellow lights, dust vortices, ravens,
cobras, or Archons.</li>

<li>Some specific quasi-human (and tough) monsters: <em
style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal">all A,
minotaurs, and the Riders on the Astral Plane</em>.</li>

<li>A special case: teleporting monsters will still teleport to the
up staircase, even if you have Elbereth engraved and an item on
top.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, peaceful monsters will not respect Elbereth.
Obviously, they won't attack you, but they will walk over the
space&#8212;not picking anything up, but possibly eroding the
Elbereth protecting your stash. (Protecting that space from
peaceful monsters is left as an exercise for the reader.) How do
you tell if a monster is peaceful? Use the "/" command to identify
the monster (and you'll see, for instance: "o an orc (peaceful hill
orc)").</p>

<h3><a id="engrave" name="engrave">What's the best way to engrave
Elbereth?</a></h3>

<p>Well, first, it's best to engrave when you've got all your wits
and senses about you. That is, you have the following chances of
messing up <strong>each letter</strong> if you are: blind (1/9),
confused (1/12), stunned (1/4), or hallucinating (1/1). So don't
count on engraving Elbereth correctly if you're impaired.</p>

<p>You can, of course, engrave in a number of different ways. The
relevant qualities are summed up below, and then each method is
detailed.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Text burned into the floor will not erode from being stood on
or walked over.</li>

<li>Text engraved in the floor lasts a while, but will erode over
time.</li>

<li>Text written in the dust doesn't last long at all.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Speed</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast methods of engraving are writing in the dust or using a
wand or athame. You can write up to ten (10) letters in one turn
with a fast method.</li>

<li>Slow methods of engraving are with edged weapons and hard gems;
they take one turn per letter.</li>
</ul>

<p>The importance of duration should be obvious. Speed is important
because while you are engraving, anything can and will attack you:
you don't get Elbereth's protection until you're finished
engraving. What's more, the attack won't interrupt your
engraving&#8212;once you start engraving, you can't protect
yourself until you are done. For this reason, if you are under
attack, you should <em>only</em> engrave by a fast method. In
addition, if you are under attack and want to add an Elbereth to a
square that already has one, only add one; if you add more than
one, you can be attacked before you finish; think of it as
obscuring the monsters' view for too long.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<ul class="space">
<li><em
style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal">Burning into
the ground</em>. Text written with a wand of fire or lightning
(with at least one charge) will be burnt into the ground, and will
not erode. (It will vanish if you engrave over it with a wand of
cold; you can also remove it by engraving in the ground; see
below). Because this is done with wands, it is a fast method.</li>

<li><em
style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal">Engraving in
the ground</em>. This can be done with a wand of digging, a hard
gemstone (diamond, ruby, jacinth, sapphire, black opal, emerald,
aquamarine, topaz), a ring with a hard gemstone (diamond ring,
etc.), a steel ring, or an edged weapon. You can also melt into ice
with a wand of fire, which erodes like an engraving. Note that the
speed depends on the method; wands and athames take one turn to
write Elbereth, the other methods here take one turn per letter. 
<ul>
<li>Engraving with any edged weapon <em>other</em> than a
non-cursed athame (including Magicbane) will dull the weapon,
reducing its enchantment. In addition, if you engrave with a +0
weapon and type "Elbereth" at the prompt, "What do you want to
engrave in the floor here?," you will get the following message:
"Your [weapon] gets dull. You only are able to write "Elberet"
--More-- You cannot write any more." 
<p>Thus, if you need to write Elbereth with just one +0 non-athame,
first engrave "Elb" and then add "ereth" to the engraving. Odd, but
true, because of how engraving is treated: engrave 1-3 letters and
lose one enchantment from a weapon; 4-5, lose 2; and 6-7, lose 3. A
-3 weapon is too dull to engrave with. (Of course, you could also
use two +0 weapons, or one weapon at +1 or greater, if
practical.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><em
style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal">Writing in
the dust</em>. This can be with your finger, a soft gem, a ring
without a hard gem, any charged wand except digging, fire, or
lightning, and so forth. Note that you have a 1/25 chance of
screwing up each letter if you're engraving in the dust. While this
only takes one turn, any movement&#8212;like fighting&#8212;on your
part will smudge it out. Even staying put will erode it, since
no-one stands <em>perfectly</em> still. In other words, if you
write in the dust, you can't expect it to last very long. However,
the higher your dexterity is, the more slowly it will smudge. You
can also avoid smudging completely by levitation over the writing
in the dust.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also scrawl on the floor in blood, if you write with
your fingers while polymorphed into any V or &amp; (same chance of
screwing up letters as if writing in the dust), or scribble on the
floor with a magic marker. The first is unlikely to come up all
that often, and the second is unwise because usually you have much
better uses for magic marker charges. However, they're there if you
need them.</p>
