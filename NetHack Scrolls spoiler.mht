<P>(Adapted from the spoiler "scrolls", by Ian Burrell.)</P>
<P>In order to read a scroll, you must either be unblind or know the =
APPEARANCE=20
of the scroll. When a scroll is read, it will be used up and disappear =
(except=20
blank paper). The effects depend on the blessing of the scroll. =
Non-cursed means=20
either blessed or uncursed. If you are confused while reading the =
scroll, "you=20
mispronounce the magic words" and may obtain a different effect. Some =
scrolls=20
have a different message for "beginners"; a character is considered a =
beginner=20
until accumulating 2000 score points (1000 for Wizards).</P>
